        <p class="deck-slogan">
            <strong>Battle tested</strong> against fungus, marine borers, fire and artillery, Naval Deck can give your home a deck that will last through the tough winters and even tougher summers that our Northest weather always delivers. Run away from the unfulfilled promises of compressed sawdust and plastic decks and come home to naturally decay resistant wood. <strong>Only creations of Nature can endure the tests of Nature. </strong>
